# Sakura Bloom Marketing Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes marketing deal data from Sakura Bloom to understand how deals are distributed across categories and sellers. The goal is to practice basic data cleaning, organization, and exploratory analysis using a real-world dataset.

This project is designed as a junior-level data analytics portfolio piece.

---

## Business Question
- How are deals distributed across different categories?
- Which categories have the most listed deals?
- How many sellers are associated with each category?

---

## Data Description
The dataset contains information about deals listed on the Sakura Bloom platform, including:
- Deal category (Development, Data, Marketing, AI)
- Number of deals per category
- Number of sellers per category

Raw data files are stored separately to preserve data integrity.

---

## Data Organization
- `data/raw/` contains original, unmodified data files
- `data/processed/` contains cleaned and prepared datasets used for analysis

Each folder includes a README explaining its purpose.

---

## Data Cleaning Steps
- Verified category names for consistency
- Checked for missing or duplicate entries
- Structured the data into a clean, analysis-ready format

No raw files were altered during cleaning.

---

## Analysis Approach
- Reviewed deal counts by category
- Compared number of sellers across categories
- Identified high-level patterns using summary statistics and simple visualizations

---

## Key Insights
- Development and Data categories contain the highest number of deals
- AI-related deals have a higher seller count relative to total deals
- Marketing deals appear more limited in volume compared to other categories

---

## Limitations
- Analysis is based on a small snapshot of available deals
- No time-based or pricing data was available
- Results are descriptive and not predictive

---

## Next Steps
- Add time-based data to analyze trends
- Explore deal performance metrics if available
- Create visual dashboards to present insights more clearly

---

## Tools Used
- GitHub
- CSV data files
- Spreadsheet-based analysis
